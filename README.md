## Elements of the extension pack

#### [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack)  
Collection of extensions that enable real-time collaborative development with VS Live Share.  
<br>
This extension pack includes everything you need to start collaboratively editing and debugging in real time, including integrated audio and text chat. This provides you and your team/class with a one-click installation, in order to begin pair programming, performing remote code reviews, driving interactive lectures, and more, without needing to leave Visual Studio Code.

#### [Live Share Whiteboard](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lostintangent.vsls-whiteboard)
Adds a real-time collaborative whiteboard to Visual Studio Live Share sessions.
<br>
Live Share Whiteboard enables you to open an integrated whiteboard, without needing to use a separate tool or service. All participants within a Live Share session can collaboratively draw on the whiteboard, and see each others changes in real-time. For certain use cases (e.g. technical interviews, mentoring, and classrooms), this can provide a useful means of communication, in addition to an audio call and co-editing and debugging.

#### [GistPad](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.gistfs)  
Manage your code snippets and developer notes using GitHub Gists and repositories.  
You can open, create, delete, fork and star gists and repositories, and then seamlessly begin editing files as if they were local, without ever cloning, pushing or pulling anything.
